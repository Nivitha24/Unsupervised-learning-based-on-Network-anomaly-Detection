Using One class SVM, Isolation Forest and Local outlier Factor


ðŸ“Š Graph 1: Class Distribution
Purpose:
This graph shows how many samples belong to each class â€” "normal" vs. "anomaly".

Why it's important:
It reveals whether the dataset is imbalanced. Most real-world anomaly detection problems have far fewer anomalies than normal events.

Key Observations:

The dataset is highly imbalanced.

Anomalies are significantly fewer than normal data points.

Conclusion:
An imbalanced dataset can affect the modelâ€™s ability to detect rare anomalies. Special handling or evaluation metrics may be required.
